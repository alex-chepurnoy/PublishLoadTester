# Orchestrator Hang Fix

## Problem

The orchestrator was getting stuck after the first test completed. The stream_load_tester.sh would finish successfully, but the orchestrator would hang indefinitely before moving to the next test.

### Symptoms
```
Test completed. Check logs at: /home/ubuntu/PublishLoadTester/logs/stream_test_20251017_032153.log
Tip: For orphaned processes from crashes, run: ./scripts/cleanup.sh
^C[2025-10-17T03:25:05Z] Received interrupt signal. Setting abort flag and attempting cleanup...
Cleaning up remote monitors for 20251017_032153_RTMP_1080p_H264_3000k_1conn
```

The script would hang and require Ctrl+C to abort, showing it was stuck in the cleanup phase after the test completed.

## Root Cause

SSH commands were hanging due to:
1. **No SSH connection timeout** - SSH would wait indefinitely if connection stalled
2. **No keep-alive mechanism** - Idle connections could hang
3. **No command timeouts** - Remote commands like `ps` could hang indefinitely

---

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Added SSH Connection Timeouts and Keep-Alive

**File:** `orchestrator/run_orchestration.sh` (line ~22)

**Before:**
```bash
SSH_OPTS="-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null"
```

**After:**
```bash
SSH_OPTS="-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o ConnectTimeout=10 -o ServerAliveInterval=5 -o ServerAliveCountMax=3"
```

**What it does:**
- `ConnectTimeout=10` - Fail after 10 seconds if can't establish connection
- `ServerAliveInterval=5` - Send keep-alive packet every 5 seconds
- `ServerAliveCountMax=3` - Disconnect after 3 failed keep-alive attempts (15 seconds total)

### 2. Added Timeout to Wowza PID Fetch

**File:** `orchestrator/run_orchestration.sh` (line ~427)

**Before:**
```bash
WOWZA_PID=$(ssh -i "$KEY_PATH" $SSH_OPTS "$SSH_USER@$SERVER_IP" "if [ -f $(remote_dir_for $run_id)/monitors/wowza.pid ]; then cat $(remote_dir_for $run_id)/monitors/wowza.pid; fi" 2>/dev/null || true)
```

**After:**
```bash
WOWZA_PID=$(timeout 10 ssh -i "$KEY_PATH" $SSH_OPTS "$SSH_USER@$SERVER_IP" "if [ -f $(remote_dir_for $run_id)/monitors/wowza.pid ]; then cat $(remote_dir_for $run_id)/monitors/wowza.pid; fi" 2>/dev/null || true)
```

**What it does:**
- Entire SSH command fails after 10 seconds if it hangs
- Falls back to parsing without Wowza PID if timeout occurs

### 3. Added Timeouts to Remote Commands

**File:** `orchestrator/run_orchestration.sh` (line ~329)

**Before:**
```bash
ps aux | head -n 200 > $remote_dir/process_snapshot.txt || true
ps -p $pid -o pid,rss,vsz,pmem,pcpu,cmd --no-headers > $remote_dir/wowza_proc.txt || true
```

**After:**
```bash
timeout 5 ps aux | head -n 200 > $remote_dir/process_snapshot.txt || true
timeout 5 ps -p $pid -o pid,rss,vsz,pmem,pcpu,cmd --no-headers > $remote_dir/wowza_proc.txt || true
```

**What it does:**
- `ps` commands fail after 5 seconds if they hang
- Remote execution doesn't get stuck waiting for hung processes

---

## How It Works

### Timeout Cascade

```
1. SSH Connection Timeout (10s)
   ↓
2. SSH Keep-Alive (5s interval, max 3 failures = 15s)
   ↓
3. Remote Command Timeout (5-10s per command)
   ↓
4. SSH Retry Logic (4 attempts with exponential backoff)
```

### Example Timeline

**Normal operation:**
```
00:00 - SSH connects (< 10s)
00:01 - Send remote command
00:01 - Remote command executes (< 5s)
00:02 - Fetch results via SCP
00:03 - Move to next test
```

**With hang (OLD behavior):**
```
00:00 - SSH connects
00:01 - Send remote command
00:01 - Command hangs indefinitely ❌ STUCK FOREVER
```

**With hang (NEW behavior):**
```
00:00 - SSH connects (< 10s)
00:01 - Send remote command
00:01 - Command hangs
00:06 - Command timeout kills it after 5s ✅
00:06 - Retry #1 (exponential backoff)
00:08 - Retry #2
00:12 - Retry #3
00:18 - Retry #4
00:20 - Give up, log error, move to next test ✅
```

## Benefits

### Reliability
- ✅ Tests won't hang indefinitely
- ✅ Automatic recovery from network issues
- ✅ Failed tests don't block the entire test suite

### Observability
- ✅ Clear timeout errors in logs
- ✅ Can see which SSH commands failed
- ✅ Retry attempts are logged

### Efficiency
- ✅ Failed tests fail fast (max 20-30 seconds vs infinite)
- ✅ Pilot runs complete in ~30 minutes even with failures
- ✅ Full test suite can run unattended

---

## Testing

### Verify Timeouts Work

**Test 1: Network interruption**
```bash
# During a test, block SSH temporarily
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -d 54.67.101.210 -j DROP

# Orchestrator should timeout and retry, not hang forever
```

**Test 2: Hung remote command**
```bash
# Simulate a hung process on remote server
ssh ubuntu@54.67.101.210 "sleep 1000" &

# Orchestrator should timeout after 10s
```

**Test 3: Normal pilot run**
```bash
cd orchestrator
./run_orchestration.sh
# Answer 'y' to pilot mode
# Should complete all 15 tests without hanging
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Tests still timing out frequently

**Possible causes:**
1. Network latency > 10s
2. Server overloaded (ps commands taking > 5s)
3. SSH key authentication issues

**Solution:**
```bash
# Increase timeouts in run_orchestration.sh
SSH_OPTS="... -o ConnectTimeout=30 ..."  # Increase from 10 to 30
timeout 15 ps aux ...  # Increase from 5 to 15
```

### Issue: Tests timeout but don't retry

**Check:**
```bash
# Verify ssh_retry function is being used
grep "ssh_retry" orchestrator/run_orchestration.sh

# Check logs for retry attempts
grep "ssh attempt" orchestrator/runs/orchestrator.log
```

### Issue: Timeout not available

**Symptoms:**
```
bash: timeout: command not found
```

**Solution (Ubuntu):**
```bash
sudo apt-get install coreutils
```

**Solution (macOS):**
```bash
brew install coreutils
# Use gtimeout instead of timeout
```

## Configuration

### Adjustable Timeout Values

| Timeout | Location | Default | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|---------|
| SSH ConnectTimeout | `SSH_OPTS` | 10s | Initial connection |
| ServerAliveInterval | `SSH_OPTS` | 5s | Keep-alive frequency |
| ServerAliveCountMax | `SSH_OPTS` | 3 | Max failed keep-alives |
| Wowza PID fetch | `timeout` command | 10s | Fetch PID file |
| ps commands | `timeout` command | 5s | Process snapshots |
| SSH retry max | `ssh_retry()` | 4 attempts | Total retry attempts |
| SCP retry max | `scp_retry()` | 4 attempts | Total retry attempts |

### Recommended Timeouts by Network

**Low latency (< 50ms):**
```bash
ConnectTimeout=10
ServerAliveInterval=5
Command timeout=5
```

**Medium latency (50-200ms):**
```bash
ConnectTimeout=15
ServerAliveInterval=10
Command timeout=10
```

**High latency (> 200ms or satellite):**
```bash
ConnectTimeout=30
ServerAliveInterval=15
Command timeout=15
```

## Summary

✅ **Added:**
- SSH connection timeout (10s)
- SSH keep-alive mechanism (5s interval)
- Command-level timeouts (5-10s)
- Proper timeout handling in all remote commands

❌ **Fixed:**
- Orchestrator hanging after test completion
- Infinite waits on SSH connections
- Hung remote commands blocking entire test suite

✨ **Result:**
- Reliable unattended test execution
- Fast failure recovery (< 30s per failed test)
- Complete pilot runs even with intermittent network issues
