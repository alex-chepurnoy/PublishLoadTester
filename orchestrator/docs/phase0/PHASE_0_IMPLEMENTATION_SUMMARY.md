## What We Built

### üéØ Goal
Implement comprehensive monitoring infrastructure to track server health (CPU, Heap, Memory, Network) and enable adaptive test stopping at 80% CPU or Heap thresholds.

### ‚úÖ Deliverables

#### 1. Enhanced Validation Script
**File:** `orchestrator/validate_server.sh`

Added checks for Java heap monitoring tools:
- jcmd (primary)
- jstat (fallback 1)
- jmap (fallback 2 - emergency only)

Tests heap monitoring functionality with actual Wowza PID.

#### 2. Four New Monitoring Functions
**File:** `orchestrator/run_orchestration.sh`

| Function | Purpose | Return Value |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| `get_server_heap()` | Java heap usage | Percentage (0.00-100.00) |
| `get_server_memory()` | System memory usage | Percentage (0.00-100.00) |
| `get_server_network()` | Network throughput | Mbps (float) |
| `check_server_status()` | All metrics in one call | CPU\|HEAP\|MEM\|NET |

**Key Features:**
- Cascading fallback for heap monitoring (jcmd ‚Üí jstat ‚Üí jmap)
- Warning logs if jmap used (causes JVM pause)
- Adaptive interface detection (ifstat preferred, sar fallback)
- Robust error handling (returns 0.00 on failure)
- Efficient pipe-delimited output for unified check

#### 3. Remote Monitoring Script
**File:** `orchestrator/remote_monitor.sh`

**Runs ON the Wowza server** to provide continuous monitoring:
- Logs every 5 seconds
- CSV format with header
- Timestamps all entries
- Auto-detects Wowza PID (re-checks if initially missing)
- Handles Wowza restarts gracefully
- Prints to stdout for debugging

**Log Format:**
```csv
TIMESTAMP,CPU_PCT,HEAP_PCT,MEM_PCT,NET_MBPS,WOWZA_PID
2025-10-17_14:30:00,45.23,62.18,58.90,125.45,12345
```

#### 4. Enhanced Deployment Functions
**File:** `orchestrator/run_orchestration.sh`

**Updated `remote_start_monitors()`:**
- Deploys remote_monitor.sh via SCP
- Starts it in background with nohup
- Saves PID for later cleanup
- Maintains all existing monitors (pidstat, sar, jstat, ifstat)

**Updated `remote_stop_monitors()`:**
- Kills remote_monitor.sh process
- Uses saved PID file
- Maintains all existing cleanup

#### 5. Adaptive Stopping in Main Loop
**File:** `orchestrator/run_orchestration.sh`

**Enhanced health checks:**
- Calls `check_server_status()` before each test
- Logs all 4 metrics: CPU, Heap, Memory, Network
- Checks CPU threshold (>= 80%)
- Checks Heap threshold (>= 80%)
- Stops tests if either threshold exceeded
- Provides detailed reason for stopping

**Log Output:**
```
Server Status: CPU=45.23% | Heap=62.18% | Mem=58.90% | Net=125.45Mbps
```

## Technical Highlights

### Heap Monitoring Strategy
```
Primary:    jcmd $PID GC.heap_info      ‚Üê Fast, no JVM pause
Fallback 1: jstat -gc $PID              ‚Üê Reliable, standard
Fallback 2: jmap -heap $PID             ‚Üê Emergency only, logs warning
```

### Why This Matters
- **jcmd** is fastest and most accurate for live monitoring
- **jstat** provides reliable fallback with minimal overhead
- **jmap** should rarely be needed (only if jcmd/jstat broken)
- Heap dumps (`jmap -dump`, `jcmd GC.heap_dump`) NEVER used during tests

### Network Monitoring Approach
```
Preferred: ifstat -i eth0 1 1          ‚Üê Simpler output
Fallback:  sar -n DEV 1 1              ‚Üê More complex but universal
```

Both convert KB/s to Mbps automatically.

### Adaptive Stopping Logic
```bash
if CPU >= 80% OR Heap >= 80%:
    Log reason
    Stop all tests
    Exit gracefully
```

This protects the 4-core Wowza server from overload and saves time by not testing beyond capacity.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Testing (Tasks 9 & 10)

1. **Validate Server Setup**
   ```bash
   ./orchestrator/validate_server.sh ~/key.pem ubuntu@server-ip
   ```
   - Install any missing tools
   - Verify Wowza detection works
   - Verify heap monitoring works

2. **Test Individual Functions**
   ```bash
   # Source the script and call functions directly
   source orchestrator/run_orchestration.sh
   get_server_cpu
   get_server_heap
   check_server_status
   ```

3. **Run Short Integration Test**
   ```bash
   # 1 connection, 360p, 1 minute test
   # Verify:
   # - remote_monitor.sh deploys
   # - Metrics are logged
   # - Health checks work
   # - Logs are fetched
   ```

4. **Test Adaptive Stopping**
   ```bash
   # Temporarily lower threshold to 50% for testing
   # Verify tests stop when threshold reached
   # Verify correct reason logged
   ```

### After Validation

Move to **Phase 1: Core Configuration**
- Update config to single-bitrate-per-resolution
- Set test duration to 15 minutes
- Configure connection array: 1,5,10,20,50,100
- Update test order to resolution-first

## Key Decisions Made

1. **jcmd as Primary:** Chosen over jstat for better readability and easier parsing
2. **Three-tier Fallback:** Ensures monitoring works even if primary tools fail
3. **No Heap Dumps:** Explicitly avoided during live testing (causes JVM pause)
4. **Pipe-delimited Output:** Efficient format for unified status check
5. **Remote Monitoring Script:** Provides detailed 5-second resolution logs independent of orchestrator polling
6. **80% Threshold for Both:** CPU and Heap treated equally for adaptive stopping

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Monitoring overhead matters:** Each SSH call has latency - unified check reduces overhead
2. **Fallback is essential:** jcmd might not be available on all systems
3. **Heap monitoring is critical:** Wowza (Java) likely hits heap limits before CPU on 4-core server
4. **CSV logs are valuable:** 5-second resolution provides detailed analysis capability
5. **Validation first:** Catching missing tools before tests saves debugging time
